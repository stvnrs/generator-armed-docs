# Armed

Armed is a [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator that simplifies the development of [ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) using a code-first compositional approach. It produces a solution consisting of a number of  template fragments which are merged together without the need for pre-processing or transformation.

This maintains editing compatibility with the [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools for Visual Studio Code (Preview)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) Visual Studio Code extension from Microsoft.
